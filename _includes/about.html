            <p>
The proliferation of pervasive <i>mobile devices</i> (such as sensors, smartphones, and tablets) generating big amount of data to be stored and processed, coupled with emerging <i>virtualization</i> and <i>programmability</i> technologies promoting the softwarized deployment of network functions and applications on top of cloud infrastructures, highly challenge the cloud. Several research initiatives are mushrooming worldwide which promise to cope with the huge computing and networking needs (e.g., high scalability, low latency, flexible orchestration and management, mobility support and location awareness) of many emerging applications and systems, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), 5G systems, big data analytics. Solutions in those directions are still at their infancy and contributions are highly required which encompass: (i) the development of innovative <i>architectures, algorithms, and abstractions for more flexible, scalable and configurable provisioning and orchestration of programmable networks; (ii) the design of novel (mobile) edge/fog computing solutions</i> meeting the growing local and distributed computing requirements, by leveraging the available resources in the edge networks and sometimes diffused onto end user devices (e.g., smartphones, vehicles, IoT devices); (iii) the deployment of new technologies for <i>high-performance processing</i>, among which solutions tackling sustainable virtualization technologies; (iv) the design of <i>new cloud service models beyond typical IaaS, PaaS and SaaS</i>, e.g., inspired by the edge/fog computing paradigms, and their prototyping and implementation, especially as open source projects.

In this respect, NetFoG aims at bringing together researchers, engineers, and practitioners to present and discuss the latest advances on both <i>theoretical and practical key technology enablers for the network programmability, spanning the data centers and descending to the edge and the ground, in upcoming future Internet and 5G systems</i>.
