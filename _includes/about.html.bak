<p>
The continuous growth of Internet content, applications and services has resulted in ever more demanding requirements of <i>computing power</i>, <i>scalability</i>, <i>data processing</i>, <i>data storage</i>, <i>energy consumption</i> and <i>transfer speed</i>. To meet this, one solution is the use of the <b><i>cloud paradigm</i></b> for applications and services. It covers a broad range of distributed computing principles as well as related application paradigms, networking approaches or architecture models. 
</p><p>
This workshop covers the scientific areas around <i>Cloud Networks, Programmability inside Networks, Cloud and Fog Computing principles, Software Defined Networking, Network Function Virtualization,</i> and <i>Software Engineering approaches for Highly Distributed Applications</i>.
</p><p>
The workshop is supported and initiated by the two EC H2020 projects INPUT & ARCADIA.
